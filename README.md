The centre for Cyber Security was identified by TIFAC (Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India) as a CORE in Cyber Security in September 2005. 
The TIFAC CORE gives significant thrust to the frontier areas of Cyber Security, including technology, practice, management, and policy issues.

This TIFAC CORE at Amrita is a collaborative alliance of academic and industrial partners. 
The unique aspect of this CORE is the coming together and partnering of industry and academia to create innovative educational and research programs and develop world-class expertise in Cyber Security.
